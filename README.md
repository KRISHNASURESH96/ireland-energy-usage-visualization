# Ireland Energy Usage Visualization 
Python project to visualize Irelandâ€™s energy consumption (1990â€“2022) using line plots and stackplots, based on data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.

This project visualizes Irelandâ€™s energy consumption from 1990 to 2022, using data sourced from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.

The notebook reads a provided CSV file, processes the data with NumPy, and produces:
  Line plots showing the annual consumption of each fuel type  
  A combined line showing total energy consumption  
  A stackplot representing the layered contributions of each fuel type over time

##  Visualizations

- **Line Plot**: Shows individual energy sources on a single figure for easy comparison over time.
- **Total Energy Line**: Highlights the sum of all sources.
- **Stackplot**: Provides a layered view showing how each energy source contributes to the total.
